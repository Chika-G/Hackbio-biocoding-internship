STAGE 1: TASK 1

Here, Python function translate a DNA sequence to a protein sequence by using a codon table. The function processes the DNA sequence, divides it into codons, and maps those codons to corresponding amino acids.

TASK 2

Here,Python function and logistic growth equation are used to simulate and generate a logistic population growth curve

TASK 2b

To generate a DataFrame with 100 different growth curves using the logistic_growth function, simulate the growth curves for each set of random parameters and store the results in a pandas DataFrame.

TASK 3

To determine the time it takes for a population to reach 80% of its maximum growth (usually the carrying capacity K), find the time t when the population size P(t) is 80% of K. This can be done by solving the logistic growth equation for P(t)= 0.8Ã—K.

TASK 4

The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. If the strings are of different lengths, pad the shorter one with extra characters (e.g., spaces) to make them the same length before calculating the Hamming distance.The function calculates the Hamming distance between two strings; the Slack username ("Onyedikachukwu") and Twitter/X handle ("Chika Chika").
